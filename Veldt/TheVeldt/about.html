                <p> Published in September of 1950, under the name "The World That The Children Made" for The Saturday Evening Post. 
                    The story renamed as The Veldt, is about a family that lives in a house with advanced technology.
                    This house feeds, bathes them, cleans itself, and does anything that its inhabitants wants of it. There is also
                    the nursery, which takes the form of any place that whoever is in it think of. The family deals with the 
                    problems of technology and feel that it is taking over their lives and that they are loosing their purpose. They talk
                    to a psychologist who suggests that they turn off the house for a while in hopes that the children will become more
                    cooperative. The children become angry at this suggestion and beg their parents to let them in one last time. The parents
                    agree to this but end up getting locked in the nursery with the African veldt as its current scene. The lions surround 
                    the parents who are trapped and that scene ends with them screaming.
